/**
 * Note: We put the recursive call in tail position, so

 * A tail-recursive function is just a function whose very last action is a call
 * to itself. When you write your recursive function in this way, the compiler
 * can optimize the resulting bytecode so that the function requires only one
 * stack frame â€” as opposed to one stack frame for each level of recursion!
