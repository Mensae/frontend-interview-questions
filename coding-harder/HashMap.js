/**
 * Implement a HashMap class without using JavaScriptâ€™s built-in objects ({}) or

 * You are provided a hash() function that takes a string and returns a number
 * (the numbers are mostly unique, but sometimes two different strings will
 * return the same number):
 * Your HashMap should support just 2 methods, get, set.
